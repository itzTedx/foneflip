# Collection Form Component

## Overview

The `CollectionForm` is a key part of the admin dashboard for managing product collections. It provides a user-friendly form that allows admins to **create**, **edit**, **save as draft**, or **restore** collections. This form is designed to make managing collections easy and efficient, even for users without technical backgrounds.

## What Does This Form Do?

- **Add a New Collection:**  
  Fill out the form to create a new collection of products.

- **Edit an Existing Collection:**  
  Update details of an existing collection, such as its name, SEO info, or settings.

- **Save as Draft:**  
  If you’re not ready to publish, you can save your progress as a draft and come back later.

- **Restore from Archive:**  
  If a collection has been archived (hidden or deactivated), you can restore it to make it active again.

## How Does It Work? (In Simple Terms)

1. **Form Sections:**  
   The form is organized into tabs for easy navigation:
   - **Details:** Main information about the collection.
   - **Media:** (Currently not active) For images or media related to the collection.
   - **Products:** (Currently not active) For adding products to the collection.
   - **SEO:** For search engine optimization settings.
   - **Settings:** For status and other configuration options.

2. **Buttons and Actions:**
   - **Save as Draft:** Temporarily saves your changes without publishing.
   - **Create/Save Changes:** Publishes the collection or updates it.
   - **Restore:** If the collection is archived, this button brings it back.

3. **Automatic Drafts:**  
   If you’re creating a new collection and leave the page, your progress is saved automatically in your browser. You won’t lose your work if you come back later.

4. **Validation and Feedback:**  
   The form checks your input for errors and shows helpful messages if something is missing or incorrect. You’ll also see notifications when actions succeed or fail.

5. **Disabled State:**  
   If a collection is archived, the form is disabled to prevent editing until it’s restored.

## Why Is This Useful?

- **Prevents Data Loss:**  
  Drafts and auto-saving mean you won’t lose your work if you get interrupted.

- **Easy to Use:**  
  The form is organized and provides clear feedback, making it simple to manage collections.

- **Safe Editing:**  
  Archived collections can’t be accidentally changed, but can be restored if needed.

## What Should Admins Know?

- You can always save your progress as a draft.
- Restoring an archived collection makes it editable again.
- The form is designed to guide you, so follow the tabs and fill in the required information.

## Technical Notes (For Reference)

- The form uses modern React and UI libraries for a smooth experience.
- Data is validated before saving or submitting.
- Drafts are stored locally in your browser, not on the server, until you save or submit.

# TODO for Collections

## 1. Add "Delete Collection" in the Collection Form (Settings Tab)

- [x] In `CollectionSettings` (`form-sections/collection-settings.tsx`), add a "Delete Collection" button at the bottom (outside or below the last `<Card>`).
- [x] Show this button only if `form.getValues("id")` exists (i.e., edit mode).
- [ ] On click, open a confirmation modal (use your UI libraryâ€™s modal/dialog).
- [ ] On confirm, call the `deleteCollection(id)` mutation (import from `actions/mutations`).
- [ ] On success:
  - Show a toast: "Collection deleted successfully".
  - Redirect to `/collections`.
- [ ] On error: Show an error toast.
- [x] Disable the button if the collection is archived or a mutation is in progress.

## 2. File Upload Enhancement

- [ ] Implement file upload component similar to https://github.com/sadmann7/file-uploader/blob/main/src/app/components/file-upload-form-demo.tsx

  - [x] Support multiple file types and size validation
